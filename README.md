TFR4SQLite
==========

Text File reader for SQLite (http://sqlite.org).  This is a SQLite extension module that enables you to create a virtual table in SQLite to parse your external structured text files.  The data from the parsed file(s) can be queried using SQL just like a native table.  See the wiki for more detail at (https://github.com/elau1004/TFR4SQLite/wiki) or the syntax railroad diagram at (https://elau1004.github.io/TFR4SQLite/doc/TFRRailRoadDiagram.pdf).
